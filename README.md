# CHALLENGE COMPLETED!

Recently, I took on the "AI Skills Challenge: Fabric Analytics Engineer" on Microsoft Learn, and it proved to be an invaluable learning experience! 

This challenge was designed for Power BI Data Analysts looking to upskill as data engineers, and it covered crucial aspects of working with Microsoft Fabric. Through hands-on practice, I gained proficiency in:

✅ Using Spark SQL to query data in tables and views
✅ Applying the medallion architecture principles in data management
✅ Creating and monitoring pipelines based on predefined templates
✅ Understanding the differences between a data warehouse and a data lakehouse

Specifically, I worked with Spark dataframes for data analysis and transformation, leveraged the Copy Data activity within pipelines, and implemented the medallion architecture framework within the Microsoft Fabric environment. Additionally, I learned how to create and manage fact tables and dimensions within a data warehouse.

Overall, this challenge provided a comprehensive introduction to the world of data engineering with Microsoft Fabric. It expanded my technical skillset and reinforced the importance of data management and architecture in delivering reliable and insightful analytics solutions.
